# 🎊 Railway TTS Deployment Complete!

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. **Railway TTS Server** 
- **Status**: ✅ Live and tested
- **URL**: `https://mynextlesson-synthesis-production.up.railway.app`
- **Voices**: Ken & Kelly (natural Piper voices)
- **Performance**: ~5 second generation for typical content

### 2. **Production Deployment**
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed with cache busting
- **URL**: `https://ilearnhow.com`
- **Integration**: Automatic failover to Railway TTS
- **Cache Bust URL**: `https://ilearnhow.com/?cachebust=1755572893`

### 3. **Testing Tools Created**
- `test-railway-live.html` - Visual TTS tester
- `verify-production-tts.html` - Production verification
- `quick-tts-test.sh` - Command line testing
- `railway-tts-integration.js` - Ready-to-use integration

## 🧪 Verification Steps

### 1. **Check Production Integration**
Open `verify-production-tts.html` in your browser to:
- Verify Railway URL is active
- Test Railway TTS directly
- Check cache status

### 2. **Test on Live Site**
1. Visit: https://ilearnhow.com
2. Open any lesson
3. You should hear natural Ken/Kelly voices
4. No more robot voices!

### 3. **Browser Console Check**
```javascript
// On ilearnhow.com, open console and run:
fetch('https://mynextlesson-synthesis-production.up.railway.app/health')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

## 🚨 If You Still Hear Robot Voices

This means Cloudflare is caching the old version. Solutions:

### Option 1: Wait (Easiest)
- Cache typically expires in 1-4 hours
- New visitors get the updated version immediately

### Option 2: Force Clear Cache
1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Select `ilearnhow.com`
3. Go to Caching → Configuration
4. Click "Purge Everything"

### Option 3: Use Cache Buster
