# 🚂 Railway TTS Deployment Guide for iLearnHow.com

## 🎯 **What We've Built**

Your Railway TTS server is now live with CORS fixes, and we've created the integration files needed to get your custom Ken & Kelly voices working on `ilearnhow.com`.

## 📁 **Files Ready for Deployment**

### **Core Integration Files:**
- ✅ `railway-tts-integration.js` - Main Railway TTS integration class
- ✅ `test-railway-tts-live.html` - Test page for ilearnhow.com
- ✅ Updated `index.html` - Now includes Railway TTS integration

### **What These Files Do:**
- **Connect to your Railway TTS server** at `mynextlesson-synthesis-production.up.railway.app`
- **Provide custom Ken & Kelly voices** using your trained models
- **Integrate with your lesson player** automatically
- **Cache voice generations** for better performance

## 🌐 **Deploy to ilearnhow.com**

### **Step 1: Upload Integration Files**

Upload these files to your `ilearnhow.com` domain:

1. **`railway-tts-integration.js`** → `/` (root directory)
2. **`test-railway-tts-live.html`** → `/` (for testing)
3. **Updated `index.html`** → Replace your current index.html

### **Step 2: Test the Integration**

1. **Visit**: `https://ilearnhow.com/test-railway-tts-live.html`
2. **Check**: Railway TTS connection status
3. **Test**: Kelly and Ken voice generation
4. **Verify**: Integration with lesson player

### **Step 3: Verify Main Site**

1. **Visit**: `https://ilearnhow.com`
2. **Check browser console** for Railway TTS ready message
3. **Test lesson playback** - should use custom voices

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Automatic Integration:**
```javascript
// Railway TTS automatically becomes available as:
window.railwayTTS.speak("Hello!", "kelly");
window.railwayTTS.speak("Hi there!", "ken");
```

### **Lesson Player Integration:**
- **Overrides** existing TTS methods to use Railway TTS
- **Maintains compatibility** with your current lesson system
- **Provides fallbacks** if Railway TTS is unavailable

### **Voice Quality:**
- **Ken**: Your custom-trained male voice model
- **Kelly**: Your custom-trained female voice model
- **Premium quality** - not generic system voices
- **Fast generation** - 5-10 seconds per voice

## 🧪 **Testing Your Custom Voices**

### **Test Page Features:**
- ✅ **Connection Test** - Verify Railway TTS is accessible
- ✅ **Kelly Voice Test** - Generate and play Kelly's voice
- ✅ **Ken Voice Test** - Generate and play Ken's voice
- ✅ **Integration Test** - Verify lesson player integration

### **Expected Results:**
- **No CORS errors** - Railway server allows ilearnhow.com
- **Custom voice quality** - Your trained Ken & Kelly voices
- **Fast response** - 5-10 seconds for voice generation
- **Seamless integration** - Works with your lesson player

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If You Get CORS Errors:**
1. **Check Railway deployment** - Ensure CORS fixes are live
2. **Verify domain** - ilearnhow.com should be in allowed origins
3. **Check browser console** - Look for specific error messages

### **If Voices Don't Generate:**
1. **Test Railway health** - Visit `/health` endpoint directly
2. **Check network tab** - Look for failed requests
3. **Verify text length** - Keep under 2000 characters

### **If Integration Fails:**
1. **Check script loading** - Ensure `railway-tts-integration.js` loads
2. **Verify global objects** - Check if `window.railwayTTS` exists
3. **Check lesson player** - Ensure it's loaded before TTS

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

### **When Everything Works:**
- ✅ **Railway TTS Ready** message in browser console
- ✅ **Custom Ken & Kelly voices** generate successfully
- ✅ **No CORS errors** in browser console
- ✅ **Lesson player** uses Railway TTS automatically
- ✅ **Voice quality** is premium (your trained models)

### **Your Students Will Experience:**
- **Natural, friendly voices** that represent your brand
- **Consistent voice quality** across all lessons
- **Professional audio** that enhances learning
- **Unique identity** that sets you apart from generic TTS

## 🚀 **Next Steps After Deployment**

1. **Test thoroughly** - Use the test page to verify everything works
2. **Create lessons** - Your custom voices are ready for content
3. **Monitor performance** - Check Railway logs for any issues
4. **Scale as needed** - Railway can handle increased usage

## 💰 **Cost Benefits**

- **Railway TTS**: $0-20/month (depending on usage)
- **Custom Voices**: Your trained models (one-time training cost)
- **Premium Quality**: Professional-grade voice synthesis
- **Brand Identity**: Unique voices that represent your platform
