# üîá macOS Voice Fix - "Lesson Orientation" Removed

## ‚ùå The Problem
When visiting https://ilearnhow.com, users heard "lesson orientation" in a macOS robot voice before the real Ken/Kelly voices started.

## üîç Root Cause
1. **Placeholder Text**: The manifest files contained `"script_text": "Lesson orientation"` as placeholder text
2. **Auto-speak**: The HomegrownTTSSystem was automatically speaking this placeholder text on page load
3. **macOS Voices**: The system was using local macOS voices instead of Railway TTS

## ‚úÖ The Fix (Deployed)

### 1. Created `block-placeholder-tts.js`
- Intercepts ALL TTS calls
- Blocks placeholder phrases like "lesson orientation", "vitamin cue", etc.
- Returns silence instead of speaking these phrases
- Loads BEFORE any TTS systems initialize

### 2. Disabled HomegrownTTSSystem
- Commented out the initialization code in index.html
- Prevents macOS voices from being used
- Forces system to use Railway TTS only

### 3. Railway TTS Takes Over
- All legitimate lesson content uses Railway TTS
- Real Ken/Kelly voices via Piper
- No more robot voices!
