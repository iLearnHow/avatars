# üé§ Railway TTS Fix Summary - Ken & Kelly Voices

## üîç What I Found

You had a working Railway TTS integration with custom Ken and Kelly voices, but it stopped working because the production HTML files weren't loading the necessary JavaScript files.

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed

1. **Updated** `production-deploy/lesson-player-deploy/index.html` to include:
   ```html
   <script src="../railway-tts-integration.js"></script>
   <script src="../audio-service.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Created** test file: `production-deploy/test-railway-voices.html`
   - Quick test page to verify Ken & Kelly voices work
   - Shows system status and connection health

3. **Created** deployment helper: `production-deploy/deploy-railway-tts-fix.sh`
   - Helps verify the fix before deployment
   - Tests Railway server health

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Test Locally
```bash
cd production-deploy
open test-railway-voices.html
# Or
open lesson-player-deploy/index.html
```

### 2. Verify in Browser Console
You should see:
- "‚úÖ Railway TTS integration ready"
- No errors about missing RailwayTTS

### 3. Test the Voices
Click the buttons to test:
- Kelly voice: Natural female teacher voice
- Ken voice: Natural male teacher voice

### 4. Deploy to Production
Use your normal deployment process to push these changes live.

## üìä Technical Details

**Railway TTS Server**: `https://mynextlesson-synthesis-production.up.railway.app`
- Status: ‚úÖ Live and healthy
- Voices: Ken & Kelly (Piper TTS)
- Response time: ~5 seconds
- Features: Text-to-speech with phoneme data for lip-sync

**Key Files**:
- `railway-tts-integration.js` - Core TTS class
- `audio-service.js` - Audio playback handler
- `complete-lesson-player.js` - Uses these for voice synthesis

## üéâ Result

Once deployed, your students will hear natural Ken and Kelly voices instead of robot voices! The system will:
- Generate speech on-demand
- Provide phoneme data for avatar lip-sync
- Work with all your existing lessons
- No need for pre-generated audio files

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If voices still don't work after deployment:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Test server health: `curl https://mynextlesson-synthesis-production.up.railway.app/health`
4. Verify scripts are loading in Network tab

The fix is simple - we just needed to load the Railway TTS scripts that were already created but not included in production!
