# Railway TTS Integration History & Fix

## üîç Investigation Summary

I've investigated your Railway TTS integration and found the root cause of why Ken and Kelly voices stopped working.

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **Railway TTS Server**: Live at `https://mynextlesson-synthesis-production.up.railway.app`
   - Health check: ‚úÖ Healthy
   - Ken voice: ‚úÖ Available
   - Kelly voice: ‚úÖ Available
   - Response time: ~5 seconds

2. **Integration Files Exist**:
   - `railway-tts-integration.js` - Defines the RailwayTTS class
   - `audio-service.js` - Handles audio playback with Railway TTS
   - `connect-railway-tts.js` - Connection utility

### ‚ùå The Problem:
The production HTML files are **NOT loading the Railway TTS integration scripts**!

Your `production-deploy/lesson-player-deploy/index.html` only loads:
- `complete-lesson-generator.js`
- `complete-lesson-player.js`

But it's missing:
- `railway-tts-integration.js`
- `audio-service.js`

### üõ†Ô∏è The Fix:

Add these script tags to your production HTML files (before the other scripts):

```html
<!-- Railway TTS Integration -->
<script src="../railway-tts-integration.js"></script>
<script src="../audio-service.js"></script>

<!-- Then your existing scripts -->
<script src="complete-lesson-generator.js"></script>
<script src="complete-lesson-player.js"></script>
```

### üìã File Organization

Here's the complete Railway TTS file structure I found:

**Core Integration Files:**
- `/production-deploy/railway-tts-integration.js` - Main TTS class
- `/production-deploy/audio-service.js` - Audio playback service
- `/production-deploy/connect-railway-tts.js` - Connection helper

**Test Files:**
- `/production-deploy/test-railway-tts-live.html` - Live testing page
- `/production-deploy/verify-production-tts.html` - Production verification
- `/test-railway-tts-integration.html` - Integration test

**Documentation:**
- `/production-deploy/RAILWAY_TTS_SUCCESS.md` - Success documentation
- `/TTS_CURRENT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md` - Current status
- `/production-deploy/RAILWAY_TTS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment guide

**Server Files:**
- `/railway-piper-server.py` - Python server code
- `/Dockerfile.piper` - Docker configuration
- `/railway.json` - Railway deployment config

### üöÄ Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Update your production HTML file:**
   ```bash
   cd production-deploy/lesson-player-deploy
   # Edit index.html to add the missing script tags
   ```

2. **Verify the fix locally:**
   Open the HTML file and check browser console for:
   - "‚úÖ Railway TTS integration ready"
   - No errors about missing RailwayTTS

3. **Test the voices:**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   const tts = new RailwayTTS('https://mynextlesson-synthesis-production.up.railway.app');
   await tts.generateSpeech("Hello from Kelly!", "kelly");
   await tts.generateSpeech("Hello from Ken!", "ken");
   ```

### üìä Working Configuration:

When properly loaded, the system works like this:

1. `railway-tts-integration.js` provides the `RailwayTTS` class
2. `audio-service.js` creates an `AudioService` that uses RailwayTTS
3. `complete-lesson-player.js` uses the AudioService for voice playback

The Railway TTS URL is: `https://mynextlesson-synthesis-production.up.railway.app`

### üéØ Why It Worked Before:

It likely worked when you first tested because:
1. You were on a test page that properly loaded all scripts
2. Or the scripts were loaded in a different order/location
3. Then during some update, the script includes were removed from production

### ‚ú® Once Fixed:

Your students will hear natural Ken and Kelly voices again, with:
- Dynamic text-to-speech generation
- No need for pre-generated audio files
- Phoneme data for avatar lip-sync
- ~5 second generation time for typical content
