# Fix Summary - Inventory Page

## Issue
The inventory page was showing assets as "Missing" because:
1. You were opening it directly as a file (`file://`) which triggers browser CORS security
2. Some asset paths in the inventory configuration were incorrect

## Solution Applied

### 1. Started Local Server
```bash
node server.js
```

### 2. Fixed Asset Paths
- Changed `base-states/kelly_neutral_default.png` → `kelly_neutral_default.png`
- Changed `base-states/ken_neutral_default.png` → `ken_neutral_default.png`

### 3. Access URLs
Now access through the server (not as files):
- **Inventory**: http://localhost:3000/inventory.html
- **Main App**: http://localhost:3000/
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health

## ✅ Result
- All assets should now show as "Available" (green)
- No more CORS errors in console
- Kelly and Ken avatars load properly

## For Production
When deployed to Railway, everything will work automatically since it's served through a proper web server.

## Quick Commands
```bash
# Start server
node server.js

# Or run in background
node server.js &

# Kill background server
pkill node
```
